# EnergyFlowSim
EnergyFlowSim is a program including following subprograms written in matlab code running GNU Octave 4.0.0 on Ubuntu 14.04:

1) weatheranalysis.m 
Description:			Analyses global radiation data from ftp-Server of the Climate Data Center (CDC) of 
				the Wetterdienst (DWD) and generate daily photovoltaic generation profiles in hourly steps
2) energyflowsim.m 
Description: 			Simulates energyflows of a partly autark charging infrastructure for electric vehicles 
				with charging sequences with fluctuating power generation and buffer battery and a basic 
	                        energymanagement algorithm
3) disp_energyflowcharts.m
Description: 			Displays graphs of some of the data generated by energyflowsim.m

The first comment block of all subprograms and functions include a description and user instructions.

Additional Information is found in the bachelor thesis with the title "Concept developement to optimize the energyflows within an 
island mode energy network with partially self-sufficient charging infrastructure for electric vehicles" (original german title:
"Konzepterstellung zur Optimierung der Energieflüsse innerhalb einer Energieverbundinsel zur teilautarken Ladeinfrastruktur für 
Elektrofahrzeuge"). The program was written as a part of this thesis.
