# EnergyFlowSim
EnergyFlowSim is a program including two subprograms written in matlab code running GNU Octave on Ubuntu:

1) weatheranalysis.m    Description: Analyses global radiation data from ftp-Server of the Climate Data Center (CDC) of the 
                        Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) and generate daily photovoltaic generation profiles in hourly steps
2) energyflowsim.m      Description: Simulates energyflows of a partly autark charging infrastructure for electric vehicles with 
                        configurable charging sequences with fluctuating power generation and buffer battery and a basic 
                        energymanagement algorithm

The Description for both subprograms and all their functions have a description with user instructions in the first comment block.

Additional Information is found in the bachelor thesis with the title "Concept developement to optimize the energyflows within an 
island mode energy network with partially self-sufficient charging infrastructure for electric vehicles" (original german title:
"Konzepterstellung zur Optimierung der Energieflüsse innerhalb einer Energieverbundinsel zur teilautarken Ladeinfrastruktur für 
Elektrofahrzeuge"). The program was written as a part of this thesis.
