function [Wpv] = pv_power(G0,Pstc,cos_psi) 
  % ======================================================================
  % Syntax: [Wpv] = pv_power(G0,Pstc,cos_psi) 
  % Description: converts global radiation in Js/cm^2 vertical on ground surface 
  % to PV energy in kWh according to PV plant peak power and radiation angle psi
  %
  % IN: G0:     numeric global radiation energy in Wh/m^2, radiated verticular on ground surface
  % In: Pstc:   scalar in Wp
  % In: cos_psi: scalar in degree
  % OUT: Wpw:  numeric PV energy gain in kWh
